# Assignment 3: Mail Client

The goal of this programming assignment is to create a simple mail client that sends e-mail to any recipient. Your client will need to establish a TCP connection with a mail server (e.g., a Google mail server), dialogue with the mail server using the SMTP protocol, send an e-mail message to a recipient (e.g., your friend) via the mail server, and finally close the TCP connection with the mail server.

For this assignment, the Companion Website provides the skeleton code for your client. Your job is to complete the code and test your client by sending e-mail to different user accounts. You may also try sending through different servers (for example, through a Google mail server and through your university mail server).
